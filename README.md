## IBM services | ‌Back-end ⚙️
*Web page to use IBM services for speech to text,NLP and translation*

In this project, I've implemented a back-end to use IBM services and provide APIs for the front-end.
- Written in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node 17](https://nodejs.org/en) 🧷
- Using Mysql database to work with data 💡
- Used by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) front-end landing, you can check [this repo](https://github.com/Nicki-Di/ibm-front) for the front-end code. 💎
